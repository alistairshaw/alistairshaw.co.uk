        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Alistair and I have nearly 20 years of commercial experience in Software Development. I specialise
            in the design and development of back-end database systems, including CRM, CMS, Email, Video and Process
            Management tools, as well as the front-end applications and websites that go with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            My business knowledge and communication skills give me a huge advantage when it comes to translating business
            requirements into working software, from initial design through to production and maintenance. I also have
            a great deal of experience as a qualified software project manager, with in-depth experience of
            Waterfall (Prince2) and a deep understanding of Agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban).
        </p>
