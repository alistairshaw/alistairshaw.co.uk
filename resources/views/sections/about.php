        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            With twenty years of commercial experience in software development, I specialise in the design and
            development of software systems with a focus on distributed systems, database architecture and
            domain driven design while writing clean and efficient code to meet specific business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            My strong business knowledge and communication skills complement my expertise in translating business
            requirements into working software, from initial design through to production and maintenance.
            I have a deep understanding of both agile and waterfall methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working primarily with PHP, Javascript and MySQL on LAMP, using both React and Angular
            as well as jQuery for the front-end.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience building highly scalable systems from the ground up, working with both monolithic
            and distributed services including micro-services and message queue architecture, makes me a
            valuable addition to any software team.
