    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Alistair and I have nearly 20 years of commercial experience as a software developer, architect
        and entrepreneur. I specialise in the design and development of back-end database systems, including CRM,
        Email, Video and process management tools, as well as the front-end applications that go with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        My business knowledge and communication skills give me a huge advantage when it comes to translating business
        requirements into working software, from initial design through to production and maintenance. I also have
        a great deal of experience as a qualified software project manager, with knowledge of waterfall (Prince2)
        and a deep understanding of Agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban.
