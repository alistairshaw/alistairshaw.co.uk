        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            With nearly 20 years of commercial experience in software development, I specialise
            in the design and development of software systems with a particular focus on distributed systems and
            database architecture. Writing clean and efficient code to meet specific business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            My business knowledge and communication skills give me a huge advantage when it comes to translating business
            requirements into working software, from initial design through to production and maintenance. I also have
            a great deal of experience as a qualified software project manager, with in-depth experience of
            Waterfall (Prince2) and a deep understanding of Agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban).
