        <h1>Keywords and Acronyms</h1>
        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>
            I currently work in a combination of PHP and Golang, refactoring PHP modules into distributed microservices
            while also delivering lots of brand new features and functionality. I am very language agnostic, I have
            significant experience with Java and Javascript (including Node.js), and a passing familiarity with languages
            as diverse as Visual Basic and C#.
        </p>
        <h2>Front End</h2>
        <p>
            I favour either Angular or React/Redux depending on the project requirements. Having worked with jQuery
            for years I avoid it for greenfield projects, but a large part of our existing codebase is written with it.
            I favor SASS over LESS, Webpack over Gulp and this website is built using Grunt!
        </p>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            I have experience in both TDD (Test Driven Design) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Design). I prefer
            to work in a test driven manner for bug fixing, there is no better way to drastically reduce regressions.
            I have also been able to very successfully leverage the ideals of BDD on legacy systems. Recently set up
            automated acceptance testing using Codeception and Selenium running headless Chrome in a Vagrant VM. Fun stuff.
        </p>
        <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>
            I am a huge proponent of Domain Driven Design and an evangelist for the SOLID principles. I have spoken
            at local user groups on Liskov Substitution and on the importance of separation of concerns and the Single
            Responsibility Principle.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            I have built several highly scalable systems, either with a distributed or micro-services architecture, as
            well as going through the process of transitioning a legacy monolith to this more flexible and scalable
            solution while maintaining continuous delivery, uninterrupted up-time and the addition of new features
            throughout the entire process.
