        <h1>Keywords and Acronyms</h1>
        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>
            I currently spend most of my time working in PHP on a fairly standard LAMP stack, occasionally with
            NGINX instead of Apache and Mongo instead of MySQL. I keep my Java skills sharp by
            developing for Android. I also manage a couple of projects written in NodeJS, so am comfortable there as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Front End</h2>
        <p>
            I favour either Angular or React/Redux depending on the project requirements. Having worked with jQuery
            for years I tend to avoid it for greenfield projects, but a large part of my existing work is written with it.
            I generally favour SASS over LESS, Webpack over Grunt/Gulp/Babelify for ES6/ES2015+, but these things are
            essentially interchangeable.
        </p>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            I have experience in both TDD (Test Driven Design) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Design). I do prefer
            to work in a test driven manner for new projects, but have been able to very successfully leverage the
            ideals of BDD on legacy systems.
        </p>
        <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>
            I am a huge proponent of Domain Driven Design and an evangelist for the SOLID principles. I have spoken
            at local user groups on Liskov Substitution and on the importance of separation of concerns and the Single
            Responsibility Principle.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            I have built several highly scalable systems, either with a distributed or micro-services architecture, as
            well as going through the process of transferring a legacy monolith to this more flexible and scalable
            solution while maintaining continuous delivery, uninterrupted up-time and the addition of new features
            throughout the entire process.
