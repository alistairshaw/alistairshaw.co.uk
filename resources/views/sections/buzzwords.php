        <h2>Back End</h2>
        <p>
            I currently spend most of my time working in PHP on a fairly standard LAMP stack, occasionally with
            NGINX instead of Apache and Mongo instead of MySQL. Also keeping my Java skills sharp by
            developing a mobile Android app. I also manage a couple of projects written in NodeJS on the MEAN stack.
        </p>

        <p>
            I favour either Angular2 or React/Redux depending on the project requirements. Having worked with jQuery
            for years I tend to avoid it if at all possible these days.
